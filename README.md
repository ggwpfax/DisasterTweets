#BERT-based Disaster Tweet Classifier

This project utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify tweets as either related to real disasters or not. Twitter serves as a crucial platform for real-time emergency communication, but distinguishing genuine disaster announcements from non-emergency tweets can be challenging for automated systems. The model leverages natural language processing techniques to analyze tweet content and predict its relevance to actual disasters, aiding disaster relief organizations and news agencies in real-time monitoring.

Dataset: The project is trained on a dataset of 10,000 tweets manually classified as disaster-related or not, encompassing a range of text including potentially offensive language.
